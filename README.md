# Undiscord-BetterDiscord
A BetterDiscord port of victorpnb's Undiscord.

Credit for source goes to [victorpnb](https://github.com/victorpnb), you can find the original source [here](https://github.com/victornpb/deleteDiscordMessages).

# About

deleteDiscordMessages, better known as **Undiscord** was a Tampermonkey/Greasefork userscript which allowed you to purge messages in any channel.
I decided to port it using the BetterDiscord plugin API which makes it so that I can purge channels without having to open a browser.

# Installation

After making sure you have BetterDiscord installed, go to the BetterDiscord plugin location whether your on `Windows`, `Linux` or `Mac`, and just paste the script into here.

**Note: If the plugin doesn't end in plugin.js, BetterDiscord won't load it.**
